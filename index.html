<p>To me, tennis is something very dear and it helps me to remain in touch with sports and actually, with life. When I have some free time, I play video games, my favorites are Minecraft, Warframe, God of War, Elden Ring, and Dark Souls, Sekiro, Bloodborne. In addition to being forms of entertainment, these games stimulate my critical mind and engage my heuristics for solving problems and making decisions. I like to create things and follow the new trends in the technologies. On the other hand, I have a low tolerance for boring routines and settings that restrict one from developing freely. Curiosity to me is a virtue and I always ensure that I remain very open to any outcomes in any pursuit I undertake.</p>
